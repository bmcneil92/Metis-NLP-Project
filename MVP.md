# MVP

For this MVP, we have created a Topic Model from 99,697 products out pulled from 186 facial cleansers from Sephora.com

Our topic model has 6 topics - all unnanmed at this time as fine tuning the topics are still taking place.

With this topic model, I was able to create a matrix for a user inputted sentence (screenshotted below) that we can use to match similiar comments to, and then match products to 
that user inputted comment. This work is still ongoing!
